# Rules #

All players are shown the same images and are given a set time within which they must describe the image in 140 characters or less. 

After all the players are done and/or the timer reaches zero, the players are shown the images again. Above the images is a description and the name of the player that submitted the description. 

The players must vote on which image they think the sentence is describing. 

# Scoring #
A player's score will be determined based on how many matches he guessed correctly, but he will get no points if no one or everyone matched his correctly.
